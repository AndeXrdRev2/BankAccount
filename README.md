# BankAccount
School Java OOD project

The user can create bank accounts to deposit and withdraw funds. You can also take out and pay off loans, with each account being limited to one loan at a time. The program can log out and sign back in to already created accounts.
Accounts are not currently saved between sessions of the program.
